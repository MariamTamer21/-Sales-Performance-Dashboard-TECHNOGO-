📊 TECHNOGO Dashboard | E-Commerce Electronics | Power BI Project 

I’m excited to share my latest Power BI project, where I built an interactive Sales Dashboard for a fictional e-commerce company called TECHNOGO specializing in electronics (Laptops, Headphones, Smartphones, etc.).

The dashboard is designed to support the Sales Department with insights that help improve product performance, understand customer behavior, and reduce revenue loss.

🔹 Key Features:
 • Revenue by Product Category
 • Monthly Sales Trends
 • Order Status Breakdown (Completed vs. Canceled)
 • Customer Ratings by Shipping & Payment Method

🔍 Insights:
 • 33% of potential revenue lost due to cancellations
 • Smartphones received many orders but generated $0 in revenue
 • October was the peak month for sales
 • Overnight shipping received the highest customer ratings

🛠️ Tools Used:
Power BI | DAX | KPI Analysis | Data Storytelling

This project helped me enhance my skills in transforming raw sales data into meaningful business insights that can guide strategic decisions.
